# [Skeleton Stylus](http://getskeleton.com)
Skeleton-Stylus is an (un)official [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com) version of Dave Gamache's Skeleton Framework (v2.0.4). It is a simple, responsive boilerplate to kickstart any responsive project.

Check out <http://getskeleton.com> for documentation and details.

## Install

There are a couple ways to download Skeleton:
1. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:jwerre/Skeleton.git`
2. Compile the stylus: `npm install` 

*Note: Be sure you have stylus installed*: `sudo npm install stylus -g`.

### What's in the download?

The download includes Skeleton's CSS, Normalize CSS as a reset, a sample favicon, and an index.html as a starting point.

```

### Why it's awesome

Skeleton is lightweight and simple. It styles only raw HTML elements (with a few exceptions) and provides a responsive grid. Nothing more.
- Around 400 lines of CSS unminified and with comments
- It's a starting point, not a UI framework
- No compiling or installing...just vanilla CSS


## Browser support

- Chrome latest
- Firefox latest
- Opera latest
- Safari latest
- IE latest

The above list is non-exhaustive. Skeleton works perfectly with almost all older versions of the browsers above, though IE certainly has large degradation prior to IE9.
